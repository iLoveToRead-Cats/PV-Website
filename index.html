        <p> Pickering Valley Elementary School is located on 22 acres in the rural town of Eagle, 35 miles west of Philadelphia. The original PV school building opened in 1965, replacing several of the one-room schoolhouses that were used to educate the children in our community. </p>
        <p>
            Pickering Valley Elementary School strives to educate all students to meet ongoing challenges in a global society by supporting the individual child within a caring, collaborative environment. </p>
        <p> Our "Panther Pride" roars clearly with Respect, Honesty, Responsibility and Kindness. </p>

        <p> Pickering Valley was named a National Blue Ribbon school in 2016. </p>
        <p> For over 20 years, Pickering Valley has participated in the Chester County Spelling Bee. All 5th grade students participate in a 25 word spelling test in the fall of the year and the top 25-30 students on that test advance to the oral bee, held in late January. The winner of the oral spelling bee will represent Pickering Valley at the Chester County IU Spelling Bee in February. The winner of the Chester County Bee will move on to the Scripps Spelling Bee in Washington DC. </p>
        <p> Since 2009, Pickering Valley has been proud to be part ofthe National Geographic Geography Bee competition. Each year, 4thand 5th graders compete in a preliminary round in early January to have the chance at one of the 10 Finalist spots for our Geography Bee. Typically, permission slips go home to parents toward the end of November and are due back to school the beginning of December. The Finals are usually held around the second full week of January. Our winning student has a chance to move on to the Pennsylvania state competition by taking a written test that is submitted to National Geographic for scoring. Pickering Valley students always look forward to the challenging questions about our world, and each year there is something for everyone to learn! </p>
        <p> Each year schools from all over Chester County compete in a quiz-style competition. Children read books from a pre-selected list and are quizzed as a team and earn points. Teams are awarded ribbons at the end of the competition. It is a great event with only winners. Pickering Valley Elementary likes to put at least 3 teams in the Spring competition. </p>
